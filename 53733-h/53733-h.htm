<p class='c006'>The Drink Trade gave Germany her greatest weapon in the war by
helping to make the bread famine.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the wilful destruction of 4,800,000 tons of food, depriving the
nation of her reserves, that led to the appalling gravity of the submarine
menace.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>The Wages of Sin</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The time has come when it should be said that those responsible
for our country now stand on the very threshold of eternal glory or
eternal shame. They play and palter with the greatest enemy force
outside Berlin. The news from Vimy Ridge comes to a land whose
rulers quail before a foe within the gate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not for one hour has the full strength of Britain been turned against
her enemies. From the first day of the war, while our mighty Allies
have been striking down this foe within their gates, Britain has let this
trade stalk through her streets, serving the Kaiser’s purposes, and paying
the Government £1,000,000 a week for the right to do it.</p>

<p class='c009'>She has let this trade destroy our food and bring us to the verge
of famine; she has let it keep back guns and shells and hold up ships;
she has let it waste our people’s wealth in hundreds of millions of
pounds; she has let it put its callous brake on the merciful Red Cross;
she has let it jeopardize the unity and safety of the Empire—for it may
yet be found, as Dr. Stuart Holden has so finely said, that the links that
bind the Pax Britannica are solvable in that great chemist’s solvent,
alcohol.</p>

<p class='c009'>The witnesses are too great to number; we can only call a few.
There is no room for all those witnesses whose evidence is in the House
of Commons Return 220 (1915), showing the part drink played in the
great shell famine, in delaying ships and guns, and imperiling the Army
and the Fleet.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the indictment is heavy. I charge this trade with the crime
the King laid at its door two years ago, the crime of prolonging the war;
and the witnesses are here at the bar of the people. The verdict is with
them, and the judgment is with those who rule.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>The wages of sin is death: What are the wages of those who fail in
an hour like this?</i></p>

<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>Fiddling to Disaster</h2>
</div>

<div class='sansserif'>

<p class='c008'>We are not going to lose the war through the submarines if we all behave
like reasonable human beings who want to save their country from disaster, privation
and distress.</p>

</div>
<div class='small'>

<div class='c010'><i>The Prime Minister</i></div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><i>What are we to say of a Government that plays with war and drink
and famine while these brave words are ringing in our ears?</i></p>

<p class='c009'>If the situation is so desperate that we must all go short of food, it
is desperate enough for the Government to be in earnest. But what are
the plain facts? No reasonable man who knows them can say that the
Government is in earnest.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not denied by anybody who knows the facts that drink has been
the greatest hindrance of the war. There is not a doubt that it has prolonged
the war for months and cost us countless lives. It is the duty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of the Government to face a dangerous thing like this; it is its duty to
pursue the war with a single eye to the speediest possible victory. But
the records of our war Governments in dealing with drink have been
records of fiddling and failure, and we stand in the third year of the war
with a Government fiddling still.</p>

<p class='c009'>One thing will be perfectly clear if disaster and famine come. It
will be known to all the world that the Government knew the facts in
time to save us. We are in the war because we would not listen in
times of peace. We are in the third year of the war because we would
not listen in the first. We are faced with famine because we would not
listen in times of plenty, when drink was breaking down our food reserves.
And we are drifting now, nearer to disaster every day, because
the Government surrenders to the enemy worse than Germany.</p>

<p class='c009'>It does not matter where you look, or when; the evidence of the
fiddling is everywhere about you. Take the week before the Prime
Minister’s grave speech about submarines—ending May 19.</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'><i>Submarines destroyed 27 British cargoes, mostly over 1600 tons.</i></p>

</div>
<div class='sansserif'>

<p class='c009'><b>Brewers destroyed 27 British food cargoes, totaling 9000 tons.</b></p>

</div>
<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'><i>The granaries of Canada were crammed with wheat waiting for British ships,
but there were no ships to bring this people’s food.</i></p>

</div>
<div class='sansserif'>

<p class='c009'><b>The rum quay at London Docks was crammed with casks of rum to last
till 1920, but a ship arrived with 1000 Casks more.</b></p>

</div>
<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'><i>A woman was fined £5 for destroying a quartern loaf.</i></p>

</div>
<div class='sansserif'>

<p class='c009'><b>Brewers were fined nothing for destroying millions of loaves.</b></p>

</div>
<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'><i>Poor people waited in queues to buy sugar in London.</i></p>

</div>
<div class='sansserif'>

<p class='c009'><b>Cartloads of sugar were destroyed in London breweries.</b></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>And so we might go on, looking on this picture and on that till
the mind almost reels with the solemn farce. The Prime Minister has
suggested that the farce does not end because those who demand its
end cannot make up their mind. It is the Government that cannot make
up its mind.</p>

<div class='sansserif'>

<p class='c009'>It tells Parliament that no more rum is to be imported, and goes on importing
rum for years ahead.</p>

<p class='c009'>It forbids the use of spirits less than three years old, and reduces the three
years to 18 months.</p>

<p class='c009'>It restricts beer to 10,000,000 barrels, and tells us one day that it is all-inclusive,
and the next day that the Army Council can order as much extra beer as it likes.</p>

<p class='c009'>It issues a report saying that hops are not food, and gives up hundreds of thousands
of feet to shipping them; 23,000 cubic feet the other week.</p>

<p class='c009'>It tells us that not an inch of shipping is wasted, and wastes shipping on bringing
brewers’ vats from America and taking gin to Africa.</p>

<p class='c009'>It tells us that the Drink Trade gave up its distilleries patriotically, and leaves
us to discover that it was made the subject of a bargain by which bread was being
destroyed for whisky as late as May this year.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>It is quite clear that the Government is desperately in need of a
scapegoat, and desperately in need of a defense. Prohibition Russia
is not mightily impressed with our drinking; serious Canadians are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>asking how long they are to sacrifice their manhood to our brewers;
America is asking already why she should go short of bread in order
that England may drink more beer.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Government must clearly say something in view of these things,
and it has put its defense in the care of one of the sanest and cleverest
men in the United Kingdom, Mr. Kennedy Jones. If Mr. Jones does
not make out a case for it, there is no case to make. What does he say?</p>

<p class='c009'>1. <i>We are told that only five per cent. of malt can be mixed with
flour for bread.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>All over the country this explanation is supposed to satisfy those
simple, honest people who know little about percentages but ask plain
questions at Food Economy meetings. It is preposterous nonsense.
If we have 200,000 tons of malted barley, what on earth does it matter
whether we mix it at fifty, or five, or two per cent., so long as we do
mix it? <i>It adds 200,000 tons to our bread in any case.</i> This talk of five
per cent., puzzling to people who think it means that only one-twentieth
of this malted barley can be used, is pitiful evidence, surely, of the straits
to which the Food Controller’s Defense Department is reduced.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <i>We are told that the barley destroyed for beer would give the nation
only ten days’ bread.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>It would actually last us a fortnight. Drink, which has taken a
quartern loaf from every British cupboard in every week of the war,
is taking still a quartern loaf a month from every cupboard, and the
desperate appeals of Mr. Kennedy Jones will be more effective in saving
crumbs when he can tell us that he has stopped this monstrous
destruction of over 1,000 tons of grain a day.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. <i>We are told that our munition workers are dependent on beer.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>It is an astounding slander. However true it may be of Governments,
it is not true of our workmen. For four months the workman
has been the scapegoat of this Government in its surrender to this trade,
and we are asked at last to believe that these men who saved us from
the Shell Famine are willing to drink us into a Bread Famine. Does
the Government never pause to ask how millions of munition workers
in America and Canada and the United Kingdom manage without beer?
Does nobody in the Government know that the greatest steel furnaces
in America are under total Prohibition, and that two million American
railwaymen are subject to instant dismissal if they touch drink while
on duty? Has the Government not read its own report of the Royal
Society Committee which had this point in mind six months ago, and
told us, on the highest authority in this country, that soldiers march
better and keep fitter without alcohol; that men do more work on less
energy without alcohol; and that “the records of American industrial
experience are significant in showing a better output when no alcohol
is taken by the workmen”?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>4. <i>We are told we need this trade for yeast.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>We need not bother overmuch about that. Industrial alcohol will
give us all we want, and there is no need to carry on this dangerous
trade for the sake of yeast. We do not need a single ounce of brewer’s
yeast, and we can do without distiller’s yeast as well by setting up a
thousandth part of the machinery we have set up in the last two years.
Or, while we must have yeast, we need about 30,000 tons a year for the
whole United Kingdom, and since the prohibition of hops in June last
year <i>we have given enough shipping to hops every fortnight to bring in
enough yeast for a year</i>. A Government with shipping to spare like
that, with room on its ships for mountains of hops, for enormous brewers’
vats, and for rum for 1921, can find room for 100 tons a day of the
people’s bread. It is a monstrous perversion of the facts to suggest that
we must maintain this food-destroying trade, with all its hideous
tragedy and ruin, in order to make bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>It cannot be said that a Government with such desperate excuses
is in earnest. We do not wonder that a great American farmers’ paper,
with no axe to grind except that it is sane and patriotic and believes in
the war, is asking plain questions as America prepares her Prohibition
Army, her Prohibition Navy, and stops the destruction of grain for
drink in order to enter the war at full strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let the Food Controller, the Prime Minister, and every responsible
citizen of the United Kingdom read this—it is from the most influential
flour-milling paper in the world, the “North Western Miller,” published
in Minneapolis:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<b>Since the United States will be called upon to make food sacrifices
on behalf of the Allies, it is certainly in order to call to account the
stewardship of Great Britain in regard to food supplies. Ordinarily
America would have no right to demand such an account, but Americans
are now asked to deny themselves that Britain may have sufficient.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>“<b>Britain has not seen fit to prohibit the use of cereals in the manufacture
of drink, notwithstanding that the world’s food supply was obviously
short. Are Americans required to forego a part of their accustomed
ration of bread in order that their British Allies can continue
to have a plentiful supply of beer and whisky? If not, then Britain
should lose no time in putting its house in order, quitting the drink to
add to the common store of food upon which the safety of all the Allies
depends.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>“<b>The food supply for the Allies is no longer a purely local proposition,
to be used as a football in British politics; it deeply concerns the
people of the United States, who are certainly not called upon to deny
themselves bread in order that Britain shall have drink.</b>”</p>

<p class='c009'>What is the Government’s answer to this? “We owe a very considerable
debt of gratitude to the great American people for the effective
assistance they are rendering us,” says the Prime Minister.
<i>Is this the way we pay them back?</i> It is an ugly question for our great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Ally to have to raise as she comes into the war, flinging her Prohibition
Navy in to smash the drink-made menace of the submarine. It is unthinkable
that the Government can read these bitter words unmoved,
or can leave this stain on our history in the face of all these questionings.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is another question, too, that comes across the Atlantic.
What is the Government going to do with the soldiers of America’s
Prohibition Army, and the sailors of America’s Prohibition Navy, when
they come over here? Are they to be broken in their thousands, made
useless and degraded as thousands of men from Prohibition Canada have
been, by the enemy that traps them before they reach the war?</p>

<p class='c009'>They are questions for the Government and the nation, and they
must be answered in the interests of the nation, and not to please the
trade that helps the Germans every day. We cannot afford to pay the
appalling price the future will demand unless our fiddlers change their
tune.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>The Drink Trade and Our War Services</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'><b>It is not possible to measure the strain the Drink Traffic has imposed
on our war services.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>The Food Controller’s Organization, with its great offices and
staffs, would not have been needed had we saved the food destroyed
by drink.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rationing already involves 1,200 committees, and may mean 50,000
officials and 50,000,000 tickets weekly. It could all be avoided. Prohibition
would save more bread without food controlling than all the
food controlling can save without Prohibition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The National Service, with its network of officials, its costly advertising,
its absorption of paper and printing, could all have been avoided
under Prohibition. About 200,000 men have enrolled, but Prohibition
would give us twice that man-power any day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The strain on a host of men and women looking after soldiers’ children
neglected through drink, soldiers’ wives spending allowances on
drink, is incalculable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The strain on war charities and the strain on the police arising
from drink are both very great.</p>

<p class='c009'>The strain of drink on doctors, nurses, and hospitals is beyond belief.
Prohibition would set free for the Red Cross thousands who waste
their time on the great drink trail.</p>

<p class='c009'>The strain on transport is seen in the long lines of wagons drawn
by strong horses carting beer to public-houses. This year alone the
handling of drink must equal the lifting of at least 9,000,000 tons, and
the barrels of beer would fill nearly all the railway wagons in the kingdom.
As to ships, drink materials during the war have used up 60
ships of 5,000 tons working all the time.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>On Lord Milner’s estimate of 19 barrels to the truck it would require
4,500,000 railway trucks to carry the 17,000,000 tons of beer manufactured
in the United Kingdom during the war.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>It can be proved from official figures that the weight of drink-stuff
carried about since war began has been equal to the weight of solid
material carried by the Navy to all our fighting fronts.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>It is a crying shame that the strength of Britain should be destroyed
like this in such an hour as this.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>The War-Work of the Food Destroyers</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There are hundreds of great Food Destructors in the United Kingdom.
The man-power at their service, spread over our breweries and
distilleries, numbers hundreds of thousands of men; their capital is
hundreds of millions. This is a summary of the work they did in the
first 1,000 days of the war:</p>

<p class='c009'><b>They sacrificed 4,400,000 tons of grain and 340,000 tons of sugar,
enough to ration the whole United Kingdom with bread for 43 weeks
and sugar for 33 weeks.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>They took from every kitchen cupboard in the land 600 pounds of
bread and 76 pounds of sugar.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>They destroyed bread and sugar to last every child under fifteen
for every day of the war.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>They took from our people over £512,000,000.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>They used up labour and transport for lifting over 50,000,000 tons.
By sea they used up 60 ships of 5,000 tons; by rail their raw materials
and the finished products would make up a train long enough to reach
nearly round the world.</b></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>The Food Now Being Destroyed for Beer</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Look at the actual facts about beer alone. We will ignore distilling,
as it gives us munitions and yeast. Had the Government tried to solve
the yeast question it could have solved it easily in these three years;
it would have had no more trouble with that problem than Russia and
Canada and America have had. But as the Government is still investigating
the yeast question, we will confine our figures to beer.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Brewers are destroying 450,000 4-lb. loaves a day.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>This year’s food destruction for beer alone will equal five weeks’
bread rations and four weeks’ sugar rations for the whole United
Kingdom.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>We have seven critical weeks in this summer, and this year’s destruction
of food would carry us through.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>Beer alone is taking 10 pounds of sugar a year from every kitchen
cupboard, and an ounce of sugar a day from every soldier.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>That is what drink is doing at this moment with the shadow of
famine creeping on.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>The Shadow of Famine</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Government came into office with the food shortage in sight;
it was its first duty to build up the great reserve of food we might have
had now in our granaries if the drink trade had not destroyed it. We
could have laughed at submarines, for our barns would have been filled
to overflowing, and we could have lived in comfort for a year if no
ship reached us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us see how much food drink has destroyed during the war.
We will take it from August 4, 1914, to April 30, 1917. It is 999 days
of the war. The grain and sugar destroyed for drink have been:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>

    <td class='c005'>4,400,000 tons</td>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>How Canada sees it—A Canadian cartoon of the callous destruction of bread  for beer and whisky</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is not easy to realize what this means, but it will help us if we
think of one or two examples.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>The biggest thing ever set up on earth is the Great Pyramid. It is
80,000,000 cubic feet. The food destroyed by drink during the war
would make two Great Pyramids, each bigger than the Pyramid of
Egypt.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>The longest British railway is the Great Western; it is over 3,000
miles, but it would not hold the food destroyed by drink since war began.
If every inch of it were crammed with wagons, the Great Western
Railway would need hundreds of miles more line to hold the train-loads
of food destroyed.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><b>There are about 750,000 railway wagons in the United Kingdom,
but if the Drink Trade had them all they would not hold the food it
has destroyed.</b></p>

<p class='c009'><b>There are about 30,000 engines on our British railways, and if the
food destroyed were made up in trains of 125 tons apiece, all our engines
would not pull them; we should still want 10,000 more.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>So vast is this incredible quantity of food destroyed by an enemy
trade while famine has been coming on. We should have saved it all
if Parliament had followed the King, and it would have given the
whole United Kingdom its flour rations for nearly a year. Take it at
its minimum scientific human food value, and on the basis of our rations
in May, 1917, it would have given us:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c004'>Flour for the whole United Kingdom</td>
    <td class='c005'>43 weeks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c004'>Sugar for the whole United Kingdom</td>
    <td class='c005'>33 weeks</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c009'>Our three war Governments, confronted with the increasing certainty
of at least a three-years’ war, have allowed the Drink Trade to
destroy this vast reserve of food.</p>

<p class='c009'>The full toll of this trade upon our scanty food supply, growing
shorter and shorter while the queues outside our food shops grow longer
and longer, is staggering indeed, even now with drink about three-quarters
stopped. We must remember that it makes no difference that
the barley has been malted; it is still good human food, and every ounce
of it should be mixed with grain for making bread. Let us remember,
also, that <i>brewer’s sugar is a good pure sugar</i>, the objection to it being
largely the objection most of us have to standard bread—its colour.
Malt or sugar, every ounce a brewer destroys is food stolen from the
people. Let us take expert opinion on the subject.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Food Value of Brewer’s Sugar</h3>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c012'>We do not, of course, use this dark sugar when white sugar is cheap and easily
procurable, but during the war we have used it for coffee, cocoa, and tea; and for
puddings where colour did not matter. We have used it a good deal in our bakeries
for chocolate goods, where colour again does not matter. It is a good, pure sugar,
and the colour is the principal drawback.</p>
<div class='c010'><i>Letter to Arthur Mee from a London caterer</i></div>

</div>

<h3 class='c011'>The Food Value of Brewer’s Malt</h3>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c012'>Malt flour can be used to make excellent cake with 50 per cent. wheat flour. It is
sweet and pleasant to taste without the need of any sugar. Good scones can be made
with 25 per cent. of malt flour. Its use in bread made with yeast causes too much
fermentation in the bread, but it has no effect on baking-powder. The Food Controller’s
Department is aware of the practicability of using malt flour, but the sale is
restricted in order to limit its use for making beer. Brewers and maltsters are too
patriotic to wish to use for beer what could be applied to food in case of a serious
shortage, and the large stocks of barley and malt can supplement the supply of wheat
flour.</p>
<div class='c010'><i>Letter from a Brewer in the “Times,” April 11, 1917</i></div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Yet we have seen our Government holding up sugar for brewers;
we have seen our Food Controller refuse to release a caterer’s sugar
unless it were sold to a brewer; we have seen a Government short of
food-ships bringing in brewers’ vats and casks of rum; and we see the
Government still holding up this malt that would feed a people asking
for more bread.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>The Tunes They Play</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Strange tunes we hear the fiddlers play, but their music does not
charm away the troubles of a famine-threatened land. From morning
till night the prayer of the people rises, “Give us this day our daily
bread,” but the heart of Downing Street is hardened, and the nation’s
bread goes day by day to the destroyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all the time we see the measure of the courage of our rulers on
the hoardings in the streets. We know their posters by heart.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Defeat the enemy’s attempt to starve you</i>, by—not by stopping the destruction
of food, but by joining the National Service, and probably
helping to pick hops. There was a man in a co-operative store who
volunteered for National Service, and last month he received instructions
<i>to leave the grocery store and take up duty in a brewery</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Sow your window-boxes and plant your back gardens</i>—and Mr. Prothero
will see that the soil of a million back gardens is wasted on hops.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>We have not enough food to last till the harvest</i>—why not go out and
catch rabbits, asks Lord Devonport—and sit and wait for sparrows?</p>

<p class='c009'><i>We must save every pound of bread we can to get over our critical
weeks</i>—not by saving the quartern loaf that beer is taking every month
from every British cupboard now, but by going hungry so that drinkers
may not thirst.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>We must not eat more than our share, on our honour</i>—but the man
across the table can eat his share of bread and drink somebody
else’s too.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>We must eat less and eat slowly</i>—so that brewers may waste more
and waste quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>We must keep back famine</i>—but not by using malt, says Captain
Bathurst: that would cost three times as much as letting famine come.
<i>But why not keep the malt till bread is as dear as gold?</i></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Let all heads of households abstain from using grain except in bread</i>,
says the King’s Proclamation. But let the brewers waste 8,000 tons
a day for beer, says the Government.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>God speed the plough and the woman who drives it</i>—yes, and God help
the woman who drives the plough to feed the brewer while her little
ones cry for bread.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Let us fine £5 whoever wastes a loaf</i>, says the Food Controller—but
not, of course, the brewers who waste 450,000 quartern loaves a day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hops are no use as food to anybody, says the Board of Trade Scientific
Committee. “<i>Then let us grow only half as many</i>,” said Mr. Prothero.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Lloyd George says Mr. Prothero is working “in a continuous
rattle of mocking laughter and gibes.” Yes, it is the mocking laughter
of a nation that is not really amused by sights like this. The nation
does not like to see the bread rations of 70,000 men in France cut down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>while the Drink Trade is destroying every week bread enough to last
these men a year. It does not like to see the Government sending letters
out to managers of factory canteens, begging them to be careful
of bread, while food flows through our beer canteens like a river running
to waste. It does not like to see Y. M. C. A. canteens denied
supplies of sugar while barrels of beer are stacked in great piles outside.
It does not like the calling up of discharged soldiers while thousands
of strong men are working hard all day destroying food or carting
beer about the streets; and it does net like the tragic comedies of Captain
Bathurst, who warns us that it really may become necessary in the
national interest—and then, perhaps, he drops his voice to break it very
gently—it really may become necessary, if these cake shops are not
very careful, <i>to whitewash the lower part of their windows</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, these fiddlers! And now we have a new idea from the Food
Control Department; it is a coloured poster of a Union Jack and a big
loaf on it, and “Waste not, Want not,” printed in big type. It was
being printed on the day the Prime Minister told the nation that America
had found it is no use waving a neutral flag in the teeth of a shark.
It is an eloquent and true saying, but it is also true, that it is no use
waving platitudes from copybooks in the teeth of a wolf at the door.
The Prime Minister says he is taking no chances. Let us be quite sure.
We once had a Government of which men said its motto was “Wait and
See.” <i>Are we better off, or are we worse, with a Government that Sees
and Waits?</i></p>

<p class='c009'>But there is no end to the fiddling. With Food Controllers who
hold up food for Food Destroyers; with Food Economy Handbooks that
cry out loud to save the crumbs but have no word to say about the
tons we fling away; with a Prime Minister praying for window-boxes
and a Board of Agriculture consecrating hopfields, we need not be
surprised if the nation is not mightily impressed.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>How the Allies Did It</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>All the world knows, except, apparently, the world that goes round
at Westminster, how Prohibition has helped the Allies.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>With the Shell Famine at its height—largely made by Drink—the
Prohibition Army on the East held up the enemy while Britain fought the
Drink Trade for her shells.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><i>With the Bread Famine looming in sight—largely made by Drink—the
Prohibition Navy from the West flings in her power against the submarines.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, for the spirit of our Allies in this land! If France wants to
rouse the spirit of Verdun she strikes down her foe at home and puts
absinthe away. If Russia wants to be great and free she stops this
drink and orders out the Romanoffs. If Canada wants to give her utmost
help to Britain she stops this drink from sea to sea. If Australia
wants to make her soldiers fit she trains them in her Prohibition camps.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>If America wants to beat the whole world at making shells she drives
drink from her workshops. If San Francisco has an earthquake she
stops drink while she pulls herself together. If Liverpool has a dangerous
strike she shuts up public-houses and keeps the city quiet. Oh,
for a Government of Britain that will see what all the world can see!</p>

<p class='c009'>History will do justice to the part the Prohibition policy of the
Allies has played in saving Europe, but a pamphlet has no room for
these things. We can take only one or two great witnesses to the
mighty achievements of our Prohibition Allies. Let us begin with
France, and call our own Prime Minister to tell us what they did. Mr.
Lloyd George:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>One afternoon we had to postpone our conference in Paris, and the French Minister
of Finance said, “I have to go to the Chamber of Deputies, because I am proposing
a bill to abolish absinthe.” Absinthe plays the same part in France that whisky
plays in this country, and they abolished it by a majority of something like ten to one
that afternoon.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>And how did Paris take this prohibition that men said would cause
a revolution? Let us ask Mr. Philip Gibbs, whose splendid letters home
have made his name a household word. Mr. Philip Gibbs:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>Absinthe was banned by a thunderstroke, and Parisians who had acquired the
absinthe habit trembled in every limb at this judgment which would reduce them to
physical and moral wrecks. But the edict was given and Paris obeyed, loyally and
with resignation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>And now we come to Russia, to these mighty Russian people who
in the last year of vodka saved £6,000,000 or £7,000,000, and in the last
full year of Prohibition saved £177,000,000. We will call our own
Prime Minister again:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>Russia, knowing her deficiency, knowing how unprepared she was, said, “I must
pull myself together. I am not going to be trampled upon, unready as I am. I will
use all my resources.” What is the first thing she does? She stops drink.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was talking to M. Bark, the Russian Minister of Finance, and I asked, “What
has been the result?” He said, “The productivity of labour, the amount of work
which is put out by the workmen, has gone up between 30 and 50 per cent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I said, “How do they stand it without their liquor?” and he replied, “Stand it?
I have lost revenue over it up to £65,000,000 a year and we certainly cannot afford it,
but if I proposed to put it back there would be a revolution in Russia.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>How completely teetotal Russia became we read long ago in the
<i>Daily Mail</i>, to which Mr. Hamilton Fyfe sent this message from Petrograd:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>Try to imagine all the publichouses in the British Isles closed; all the restaurants
putting away their wine cards and offering nothing stronger than cider or ginger ale.
That is the state of things in Russia. Strange it seems indeed, yet there is one thing
stranger. Nobody makes any audible complaint.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Everywhere in Russia it was the same: a nation was made sober
by Act of Parliament.</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>“Without a murmur of protest,” said the Moscow correspondent of the <i>Times</i>,
“the most drunken city in Europe was transformed into a temple of sobriety, and we
felt that if Russia could thus conquer herself in a night, there was indeed nothing
that might not be accomplished.” And two years later, when the revolution came, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>read in the <i>Times</i> this note from Odessa: “Perfect tranquillity continues to prevail
here, although for the moment Odessa is practically without police. The satisfactory
absence of crime may largely be attributed to the sealing up of spirituous liquors.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>We need not be afraid of Drinkless Revolutions.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the truth about Russia is almost too incredible to believe, for
it is Prohibition that made the revolution possible; it was stopping drink
that set 170,000,000 people free. We will let a business correspondent
of the <i>Times</i> give evidence; here is what he said on April 21, 1917:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>In one respect it must be said that the Reactionaries saw clearly. They always
claimed that the Tsar had ruined himself by decreeing the abolition of vodka. None
but a sober people could have carried out the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>The police were, on the other hand, the victims of drink. They had seized the
vodka at the order of the Government, and had kept plentiful supplies for themselves.
Thus the Revolution was in part a struggle between drunken reaction and sober citizens.
Sobriety triumphed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The Russian people will not bow down and tie their hands to the
thrones of Europe: do we wonder if they scorn our quailing before
this trade?</p>

<p class='c009'>Free Russia flings off the dynastic yoke: do we wonder Prohibition
Russia is not much impressed by a nation with a Drink Trade round
its neck?</p>

<p class='c008'>The things that will be told against this trade when all the truth
is known will break the heart of those who read. It is well for us that
we cannot know the full truth now; the burden would be too grievous
to be borne in days like these. But if you will go into your street, or
will talk of these things with the next man you meet from one of our
pitiful slums, or will pick up one of those local papers that still have
space to print the truth, you will find the evidence close about you.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are the guardians of our soldiers’ homes; we are the trustees
of the hope and happiness of their little children; but we let this drink
trade, that takes our people’s food out of their cupboards, turn that
food into the means of death, and sow ruin and destruction through
the land.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we will call the witnesses to these drink-ruined soldiers’ homes,
these homes that the enemy worse than Germany has shattered and
broken while our men have been fighting for your home and mine. We
will call a few here and there, knowing that for every one called are
hundreds more that can be called, and that beyond all these that are
known there is in this little land a countless host of tragedies as secret
as the grave.</p>

I think it will drive me mad.”</p>

that he would kill his wife. He put a razor on the table, and his little boy
hid it in a cupboard, but a week later this boy of 12 went home and found his father
and mother lying on the floor, the father drunk, the mother dead. The soldier, drowning
his misery in drink, had strangled his wife. Rousing himself beside her, he said,
as the police found them, “Kiss me, Sally. Aye, but tha are poorly.”</p>

entered another hut and killed the bugler. “Was there no one with power to say how
much drink should be given?” asked the judge, and an officer said there was no one.

away, and in three days he was dead. “The last we saw of him,” said the poor old

have learned to drink in thousands since the war began—respectable

at home. With no restraining hand upon them, with new companionships
and pocket-money flowing freely, it is not surprising the temptation
should be too strong for them. We can take only one or two cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everywhere we hope and pray for peace, for the day when the men
will come home; but we may dread the day if the men come home to
drink and its temptations. The sudden release of millions of men, the
certain reaction after the terrible stress of these three years, is fearful
to contemplate with the door of the tap-room open. There would be
an end of civilization itself for days and weeks and months, and for
many a town at home the Peace would be worse than the War.</p>

<p class='c009'>We owe it to these men to listen to the warning of the Prison Commissioners
who printed these words in their report last year:</p>

<p class='c009'><b>When war is succeeded by peace there will come a time of trial
for those who have never turned their backs to a bodily enemy. With
the passing of military discipline our brave fellows will be tempted to

obtain, the lapse may, if not checked, become a step on a downward
career.</b></p>

can guarantee it right up to the firing line, they say, and even when
our shells could not get there through drink, drink seems to have found
its way. It can get on to transports when the Ministry of Munitions

  <h2 class='c007'>Drink and the Red Cross</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If the full story could ever be told of the national tragedy of drink
and the war there would be no more ghastly chapter than that which
would tell how drink fought the Red Cross; how, without pity, it hindered
the work of mercy that is the general consolation of the world
in days like these.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are coming to a famine not only in food, but in doctors. The
death-roll has been heavy beyond all parallel; the strain on the medical
services has been almost too great to be borne, and we look anxiously
round to know where the doctors and nurses will come from. With
Prohibition the problem would be largely solved, for the ordinary burden
of life would be largely lifted from our doctors and hospitals, and thousands
of men and women would be free to give themselves to the war
instead of mending up and patching up the sordid effects of drink. A
rich brewer gave a donation for extending a hospital. “Ah! but we
should not have to extend if he would shut up his public-houses,” said
a doctor.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>Stabbing the Army in the Back</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>All the world is learning now that the drink trade is the great confederate
of venereal disease. It leads a man into temptation, destroys
his power of resistance, and retards his chances of recovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>We can never know the truth about the extent of this disease, about
the way in which the liquor trade, by breaking down tens of thousands
of our men, has stabbed the Army in the back. But the number of soldiers
incapacitated by this disease through drink is enormously greater
than the number incapacitated by the most subtle or dramatic stroke
devised by the German staff.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lost man-power of the Army through this disease must be equal
to the whole of the original British Expeditionary Force. The Government
has given us figures for the Army at home last year, and they are
43 per 1,000—or over 100,000 cases for an army of 2,500,000 men. There
were 7,000 cases in one Canadian camp alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here are the black facts revealed in a debate in Parliament on April
23, 1917, when two distinguished Army officers, speaking with great
restraint, sought to open the eyes of the nation to this plague fostered
in our camps by drink:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>“During the war we have had admitted into the hospitals of England over 70,000
cases of gonorrhœa, over 20,000 cases of syphilis, and over 6000 cases of another disease
somewhat similar. I am quite openly prepared to state that of these 20,000 cases of
syphilis you do not get much work out of them under two and a half years. I know
from what I have seen of the modern conditions of this War that you may absolutely
wipe them out, except for a few handfuls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you come to the great mass of casualties under this head ... the figures
mean that you have <b>a Division constantly out of action</b>. If you have anything
like 70,000 men enfeebled, you find that you suffer to that extent also. It is not only
that you lose the men, and not only the men who are partially cured are suffering for
many months to come, but their chances of recovery from wounds are not nearly
so good.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know of a hospital for venereal cases which it was found necessary to expand
from its normal accommodation for 500 or 600 up to 2,000 cases, and they are continually
full. It is a British hospital in France. A figure I should like to submit to
challenge is that during the course of the war between 40,000 and 50,000 cases of
syphilis have passed through our hospitals in France. When you come to gonorrhœa,
the figure given me which covers that is between 150,000 and 200,000 cases.”</p>

<div class='c010'><i>Captain Guest in Parliament, April 23, 1917</i></div>

<p class='c012'>“Every Canadian soldier who comes to this country arrives here not only a first-class
specimen of a fine soldier, but as clean-limbed and as clean a man as the Creator
Himself could create. The fact that in one only of the three Canadian camps in this
country 7,000 of these clean Canadian boys went through the hospital for venereal
disease in fourteen months is not only a great discredit to any Government in this
country but has an effect in Canada which I can assure the House does not make for
a better feeling with the Home Country, and does not make for what we all desire—Imperial
Unity.”</p>

<div class='c010'><i>Colonel Sir Hamar Greenwood in Parliament, April 23, 1917</i></div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Those are unchallenged statements made in the House of Commons
itself; they stand as a terrible indictment of this disease, and it is not
to be denied that this evil could never have reached its present frightful
proportions if Parliament had followed the King. Let us look at a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>examples of the ravages of this vice allied so closely to the public-house.</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>It is not possible to tell the whole truth about drink; the language in which it
must be written would be offensive in a civilised country. It must be said, simply, that
soldiers in England have been court-martialled for having been influenced by drink to
commit unspeakable offences against animals.</p>

harpies carry off lonely soldiers to their rooms, make them drunk, and finally innoculate

women who prey upon and poison our soldiers? asks Sir Conan Doyle.</p>

<div class='c010'><i>Letter in the “Times”</i></div>

<p class='c012'>One of the hot-beds of venereal disease to which drink leads our soldiers, was
kept by an Austrian woman in Lambeth, who was receiving 15<i>s.</i> a week from the
Austrian Government in April 1916, and used to lure our soldiers when weakened by
drink. All the men seen to enter this house were either soldiers or sailors.</p>

<p class='c012'>A soldier came from the Front to go home to Scotland. He got drunk near

<div class='c010'><i>Facts in “Daily News,” February 14, 1916</i></div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Here is the official proof of the relation of the drink trade to this
traffic in disease. It is from the Report of the Royal Commission:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>Abundant evidence was given as to the intimate relation between alcohol and
venereal diseases.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alcohol renders a man liable to yield to temptations which he might otherwise
resist, and aggravates the disease by diminishing the resistance of the individual.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alcoholism makes latent syphilis and gonorrhœa active.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our evidence tends to show that the communication in disease is frequently due to
indulgence in intoxicants, and there is no doubt that the growth of temperance among
the population would help to bring about an amelioration of the very serious conditions
which our enquiry has revealed.</p>

<p class='c009'>We desire, therefore, to place on record our opinion that action should be taken
without delay.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>The Price the Empire Pays</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is a bitter irony that while the men of the Empire have come to
France to fight the enemy of mankind, this foe within our gates has
struck a blow at the British Empire that generations will not heal.
How many Empire men this private trade has slain we do not know,
but we know beyond all challenge that it has weakened the bonds that
bind our Dominions to the Motherland. This trade that throttles us
at home can pull the Empire down, and it has started well. It has
struck its blow at Canada.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Let us look at the plain facts which in other days than these would
have caused a storm of anger that Parliament could not have ignored.
Canada has followed the King; arming herself with her full powers,
flinging herself upon her enemies with her utmost strength, she has
swept drink out of Canada almost from sea to sea. But even before
she did this Canada saw that alcohol must go from her camps if her
men were to be fit to fight for England, and long before the Prohibition
wave swept across the country, the Canadian Government removed all
alcohol from the training camps. It was the deliberate choice of a
Government and its people, and from that day to this there has been
no reason for regret.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the young manhood of Canada, rallying to the flag, was guarded
from alcohol. She poured out her men in hundreds of thousands; they
came to us from Prohibition camps; they came in Prohibition ships, and
even here this trade that has us in its grip was not allowed at first in
the Canadian camps; the only condition that Canada made—a condition
implied but clearly understood—was properly regarded and obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>We respected the desire of Canada, and kept her soldiers free from
drink in their own camps. But a soldier cannot keep in camp, and in
the villages around the Drink Trade waits in every street. The military
authorities were willing for the Canadian Government to have their
way inside the camps, but drink was free outside, and in these public-houses
there was sown the seed that may one day break this Empire.
The Drink Trade was so rampant outside the Canadian camps that
Prohibition inside was almost in vain. We had to decide between
breaking the word of the Canadian Government to its people or dealing
with this trade as Canada herself has done; as Russia has done; as
France and America are doing. It was the Empire or the drink traffic,
and the drink traffic won, as it always wins with us.</p>

<p class='c009'>It came about in October, down on Salisbury Plain. During one
week-end a number of Canadian troops gave way to drinking in villages
around the camps, and it was then that the grave decision was come
to that the drink trade should be allowed to set up its horrible canteens
in every Canadian camp. The change was made at the request of a
British General, and we have the assurance of the Prime Minister of
Canada that the approval of the Canadian Government was neither obtained
nor asked. In handing the Canadian Army over to the drink
canteens, in deliberately reversing the policy of the Canadian Government
and its people, there was no consultation with Canada.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is important to remember that this decision, fraught with tragic
and far-reaching consequences for the Empire, was a pure and simple
English act. We may imagine the Canadian view from the remark of
a Canadian General, who said, “I know drink is a hindrance, but I can
do very little, because in military circles in this country drunkenness is
not considered a very serious offense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It would have been surprising if there had not poured in upon our
Government a stream of protests, and from all parts of the Dominions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>they came. The Dominion of Canada, giving freely to the Motherland
450,000 boys and men, was moved to passionate indignation that England
should scorn her love for them, should ignore the pleadings of
their mothers and sisters, and should put in their way the temptations
from which they were saved at home. Canada does not want our drink
trade; she lives side by side with the United States, she sees that great
country building up its future free from drink, and she sees America,
splendid ally in war, as a mighty rival in peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Canada is ready for the Reconstruction. She has followed the
Prohibition lead of the United States, and already she has ceased to
be a borrowing country. The very first year of Prohibition has seen
this young Dominion, for the first time in her history, financially self-sustaining.
Crime is disappearing; social gatherings are held in her
gaols; she has set up vast munition workshops, and instead of borrowing
money for her own support she has made hundreds of millions’
worth of munitions for which this country need not pay until the war
is over, and then need never pay at all for the munitions the Canadians
have used. Canada is in deadly earliest. She kept her men away from
drink to make them fit; she has swept it away to make a clean country
for those who go back.</p>

<p class='c009'>And what is England’s contribution to this Imperial Reconstruction?
<i>We have scorned it all.</i> The Prime Minister has said that this
drink trade is so horrible that it is worth this horrible war to settle
with it, yet we have sacrificed the love of Canada on our brewers’ altar.
We can believe the Canadian who declares his profound conviction that
but for this Canada would have sent us 100,000 more recruits; we can
believe it is true that where responsible Canadians meet together in
these days the talk is of how long the tie will last unbroken that binds
the daughter to the Motherland. We can understand the passion that
lies behind the resolutions that come to Downing Street from Nova
Scotia; we know the depth of the yearning of those 64,000 mothers and
wives of Toronto who signed that great petition to the Government of
Canada begging it in the name of God to intervene.</p>

<p class='c009'>We can understand it all; but let us call the witnesses, and let us
see the price the Dominion pays for our quailing before this Kaiser’s
trade.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>Those Who Will Not Go Back</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is the great consolation of Canada that, though their sons may
fall before this tempter’s trade in Britain, they will go back to a Canada
free from drink. But some will never go back, and they are not on
the Roll of Honour. They have been destroyed by the enemy within
our gate, this trade that traps men on their way to France and digs
their graves.</p>

<p class='c009'>A young Canadian who had never tasted alcohol came from a Prohibition camp
in Canada, came to England on a Prohibition ship, and was put in a camp with a

<h3 class='c011'>The Men From the Prohibition Camps</h3>

<p class='c012'>Again and again we have seen the peculiar temptations of drink
among Canadians. Officers, chief-constables, chaplains, newspapers,
the men themselves, have all borne witness that to these men from
Prohibition Canada the sudden temptations of our drink trade come with
terrible power, and often they fall not knowing. The finest manhood
of the Empire our tap-rooms and canteens destroy, not in isolated cases,
but in a host we dare not number.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the soldiers who first came over from Canada, says a great Canadian
paper, many were emigrants from England, not yet securely planted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>in Canada, and for their sakes especially drink should have been withheld
from them. Of the larger number of Canadian troops that followed
them, many were youths who had never known drink, and they
were taken from home at the most social and reckless age, to face drink
with all the temptations induced by the nervous strain, the hardships
and social abandon of the camp and the trench, and the free pocket-money
when on leave.</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>In an officers’ mess of two double companies of Canadians only one officer drank
on his arrival in a canteen camp in England; within three months there was not an
abstainer in the mess.</p>

<div class='c010'><i>Facts told at Society for Study of Inebriety, Jan. 10, 1916</i></div>

<p class='c012'>These men come mostly from districts in Canada where intoxicants are prohibited
by law, and many of them, being young lads, who perhaps have never tasted liquor
before their arrival, fall easy victims.</p>

<div class='c010'><i>Chief Constable of Godalming</i></div>

<p class='c012'>Overseas soldiers come to our hospitals astonishingly cheerful and fit in a general
sense, and wonderfully receptive to treatment. Only three per thousand die in our
great hospitals. This is largely due to the hardy life of the men and the fact that
they are removed from the danger of taking too much alcohol. The home troops have
a much higher mortality, partly because their use of alcohol diminishes their chances.
Re-admissions are largely due to drink on furlough.</p>

<div class='c010'><i>Major Maclean, M.D., of the Third Western General Hospital</i></div>

<p class='c012'>A Canadian soldier, who had been wounded at the Front, was taken to a house
by women and left alone drunk. An officer gave him an excellent character, and said
he was on his way back to Canada. These men experience temptations here (he said)
that they would not find in Canada, and there was too much of this going on.</p>

<div class='c010'><i>Hastings Police Records, February 19, 1917</i></div>

<p class='c012'>I heard a sad account of the havoc of the wet canteen and a private in a Canadian
A.M.C. told us of a lad of 17 who is made so drunk that there is rarely a night when
he has not to be helped up to bed. One of the soldiers here told me of his son in
Canada being anxious to join up, but after seeing the condition of things over here
he was doing all he could to discourage his son.</p>

<div class='c010'><i>Letter to the Author</i></div>

<p class='c012'>The Canadians in most cases are entirely lost when they arrive in this country,
and are much more liable to the temptation which is thrown in their way, but when
you give a figure such as this—that in one camp during last year, and two months of
the previous year, there were 7,000 cases—it seems to me that it is about time we
realised the magnitude of the evil. I do not know what has happened to them, except
that I imagine a large number have gone back to Canada, and have not been able to
play the part they had hoped to play.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>The Rising Storm in Canada</h3>

<div class='sansserif'>

<p class='c012'><b>The thing cannot be justified. It is the blackest tragedy of this whole war that,
in fighting for freedom in Europe, the free sons of the British breed have to face
this war-time record of waste at home, with its inevitable toll of debauchery and
crime.</b></p>

</div>
<div class='small'>

<div class='c010'><i>Editorial in “Toronto Globe”</i></div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>While this book was being written one of the greatest meetings
ever held in Manchester was cheering a Canadian in khaki who declared
that he was not going hungry while brewers were destroying food, and
he went on to say, this soldier and sportsman well-known in the
Dominion:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>“Great numbers of our men never saw France. Canadian boys cried because they
had not munitions. England reeled and beer flowed like water while thousands of
our boys went down into their graves. We will never forget it in Canada.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>We may be sure Canada will not forget. She will not forget her
dead: she will not forget that the Drink Traffic she has swept away at
home struck down her sons in the land for which they fought. “We
must know who is to blame,” says a Canadian paper; “we presume they
will have no objection to have their names placarded before the country,
that every mother may know.” Col. Sir Hamar Greenwood, M. P., has
lately returned from Canada, and this is what he tells us:</p>

<div class='small'>

<p class='c009'>“I met many fathers and mothers whose boys had been sent back to Canada
debilitated and ruined for life because they had been enmeshed by harpies, and again
and again these parents have said to me, ‘We do not mind our boys dying on the
field of battle for old England, but to think that we sent our sons to England to come
back to us ruined in health, and a disgrace to us, to them, and to the country, is
something the Home Country should never ask us to bear.’”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Letter from a Solicitor in Ontario to the Author</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder if the advocates of the drink traffic in Britain appreciate the contempt in
which they are held in Canada. Before the war I had a class of ten young men.
Every one of them is now at the Front, and one writes that when I told them of the
drink conditions in England he did not believe half of it; now he says I did not tell
him half. Letters from our Canadian soldiers are appearing in our papers, and they
are all amazed at the drinking habits of Britain.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>From a Resolution received by Mr. Lloyd George from the
Social Service Council of Nova Scotia</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>That we, representing the social, moral, and spiritual forces of this part of the
British Empire, who have proved our loyalty by the thousands of men this small
province has sent overseas, do record our most earnest protest against Britain’s inaction
in this matter, which we are sure must result in longer and increased suffering for the
men we have sent to help her win the war; and do most insistently plead with the
British Government and the British Parliament that they at once exercise the power
vested in them to strike the blow that will dispose of this enemy at home, and so
give mighty reinforcement to those who are bleeding and dying for Britain and human
liberties on the battlefields abroad.</p>
<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span><i>Sermon by Dr. Flanders in London, Ontario, Feb. 25, 1917</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>Canada has the right to make this demand on the Motherland from the simple
standpoint of political economics. That we might put the Dominion into the best
possible shape to give the utmost of our strength in men and munitions, we have an
almost Dominion-wide Prohibition, and no intelligent person will deny that our contributions
to the war from the first have been multiplied and intensified by that action.
Why should little Johnnie Canuck abolish drink that he might conserve his manhood
and material resources in the interest of the Empire’s war, and big John Bull refuse
to abolish the traffic to the great waste of his material resources and the undoing of
his efficiency?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>A public man with three soldier sons wrote to the Toronto Globe</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>Canada, for efficiency in war, casts out the drink evil. Is it too much to expect
Britain, in fairness, to do the same? Is it not a mockery for the British Isles to face
our common struggle with this palsy in her frame?</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is the bitter pill, the embittering thought for many a Canadian parent. Let
me be a type. Three of my sons are in khaki. I gave them a father’s blessing when
they enlisted. But this thought strains, most of all, the ties of my loyalty to the cause—to
see my sons fight and fall for a Britain that at home is saddled by distillery
interests, and misguided by a Press silent as the grave on this entrenched evil. Why
should our sons go from a country where booze is banished to spend months on the
way to the trenches in England, where the vices of the liquor traffic are legalised?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>We see the spirit of Canada in those great words of the Premier of Ontario, Mr. Hearst,
speaking of the giving up of drink</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>In this day of national peril, in this day when the future of the British Empire,
the freedom of the world, and the blessings of democratic government hang in the
balance, if I should fail to listen to what I believe to be the call of duty, if I should
neglect to take every action that in my judgment will help to conserve the financial
strength and power and manhood of this province for the great struggle in which we
are engaged, I would be a traitor to my country, a traitor to my own conscience, and
unworthy of the brave sons of Canada that are fighting, bleeding and dying for freedom
and for us.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>A letter from one of the most eminent public men in Canada</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>“British Canada is intensely loyal to the Empire and the Allied Cause, but at
present recruiting is almost at an end. Why? Partly because of considerable dissatisfaction
with many of the conditions which prevail. Suffering, wounds, death, are
expected as inevitable in war, but the evil influences, the lavish temptations of liquor
and bad women which sweep down upon our boys in England, are not felt to be
necessary, and the hearts of multitudes of Canadian parents are hot with indignation
at the apparent indifference of the authorities to the moral welfare of our troops.”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Captain John MacNeill, with the Canadian troops in France</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say to you solemnly, if England should lose this war because of drink, or if
England should unnecessarily prolong the war with great sacrifice of life in her effort
to protect drink, or even if England should win the war in spite of drink, you will
have put upon the bonds of Empire such a strain as they have never known before,
and such a strain as we cannot promise they will be able to survive.”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>From the petition presented to the Prime Minister of Canada,
signed by 64,000 mothers and wives in Toronto</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. That Mothers and Wives of Canada in giving their sons and husbands for
King and Empire, asked and received from your Minister of Militia this only assurance
that, in sending them into the ranks, we were not hereby irrevocably thrusting
them into the temptation of Strong Drink.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. We appreciated from the depths of our hearts, your action in abolishing the
Wet Canteen from the Canadian Militia. We believe the Wet Canteen established in
the ranks of the front to be a double danger, robbing our King of the success in arms
which in these days comes only to the brave heart that is controlled by a clear head,
and robbing us and our Canada of the Manhood which we gave into our Empire’s
keeping.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>3. We do not believe that the King will refuse the aid of Canada’s sons; nor that
he will appreciate your patriotic efforts the less, if you keep faith with us and make
known to His Majesty, his Ministers and Commanders, that our boys are sent forth
on the one condition that the dispensing of intoxicating liquors shall be prohibited in
the ranks.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>From a Sermon preached in Ontario, February 25, 1917</i>:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank God, if any of our Canadian soldiers return to us with the drink habit
formed and raging, we can welcome them to a land nearly purged of the liquor traffic,
where they may have a chance to recover their manhood.”</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Letter on the effects of Prohibition, from a business man in Ontario,
published in the “Spectator:”</i></p>

<p class='c009'>“Men I have known for years to be regular promenading tanks have given it up,
and are starting a decent life again. The Police Court is empty. England should try it.
It would be, after the first heavy initial loss, the best thing that ever struck the nation.
I cursed these temperance guys as hard as any, but all the same it cannot blind you
from the truth.”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>THE MEN WHO BRING IT</h3>

</div>
<p class='c012'>It is easy to talk of a mine-sweeper. I wish the whole nation could
understand what these men are doing. They are feeding the whole
population, battling with the elements as well as with the enemy, battling
with dangers overhead and dangers under the sea. The mine-sweeper
is like the soldier daily over the parapet—he carries his life in
his hand.</p>

<div class='c010'><i>First Lord of the Admiralty.</i></div>

<div class='sansserif'>

<h3 class='c021'>THE PEOPLE WHO WAIT FOR IT</h3>

</div>
<p class='c012'>A London caterer ordered a quantity of sugar from the Philippines.
The mine-sweepers cleared the way for it and it reached the docks. The
caterer sent for it, and was informed that it could only be delivered if
it was for a brewer.</p>

<p class='c009'>A provincial caterer ordered sugar <i>and paid for it</i>, but was told by
the Food Controller that it could only be released if <i>it was sold to a
brewer</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A working man was discussing rations with his minister in the
street. “It is very hard,” he said, “to keep to your rations when you
have five strapping lads, but we are going to try it.” Then a drunken
man lurched past. The workman pulled himself together, and said, in
great passion: “I tell you what it is, sir, I am not going to let my
boys starve as long as there is food to make beer for men like that.”</p>

<div class='sansserif'>

<h3 class='c021'>THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT</h3>

</div>
<p class='c012'>Immense quantities of food are used for beer and spirits. All this
grain is lost for food purposes. <i>If this grain were available for food, the
prices of bread and meat would be lowered.</i></p>

  <h2 class='c007'>The Way for the Government</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We do not want to be amused by fiddlers while our heroes fight
and die.</p>

<p class='c009'>What are the things we see? We see the Government silent in
the presence of what the greatest paper in our greatest overseas Dominion
calls “the blackest tragedy of the war.” We see a trade which the
King declared to be prolonging the war in the crisis of 1915, prolonging
it still in the crisis of 1917. We see our Prime Minister, who has
declared this trade to be worse than Germany, allowing it to have its
way. We see our Prime Minister, who has said we cannot settle with
Germany until we have settled with drink, fearing to settle with drink.
Then are we not to settle with Germany, and are we to surrender to
the greatest enemy of the three?</p>

<p class='c009'>There is one clear way before the Government; it is the only way
of straightness and patriotism and honour. It is to wind up this enemy
trade and move from our path the greatest hindrance to the winning of
the war. It is to take our side honourably with our great Allies, to
bring to an end the shameful isolation of Great Britain in the drink map
of the great free countries that appears on the back of this book.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is the sign of weakness everywhere that it seeks a scapegoat for
its sins, and we hear the everlasting talk of Labour. But it will not do.
It is time these slanders on our workmen ceased.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the Government is afraid of the working man, let it say so, or
let it try him. If it is afraid of temperance people, let it rally them
to its side as one man on the platform where they meet. If it is afraid
of the Drink Trade, then the time has come to say so, for we who send
out our millions to fight a foreign foe are not going to starve for bread
through fear of enemies within our gate. The Prime Minister gave the
Army its munitions; the Army will use them in vain unless the munitions
of life come into our homes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Working men are tired of men who fool with food and liberty.
They do not object to any equal sacrifice: they believe in the democratic
policy of the King, who based Prohibition, not on class distinction
as the Government did by closing tap-rooms 15 hours a day and
leaving cellars and Parliamentary bars open always, but on the principle
of the King’s own words that “no difference shall be made, so far
as his Majesty is concerned, between the treatment of the rich and poor
in this respect.” Let the Government follow the King, and the people
will follow the Government.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the highest interests of the nation and the war let this be said
as plain as words can make it—<i>that there is no body of temperance opinion
anywhere standing in the way of Prohibition</i>, but that the united moral
forces of the nation would rally to the Government instantly on an act
of a few words such as this:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><b>That the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages be totally prohibited
in the United Kingdom for the period of the war and demobilization,
and that a committee be appointed to deal with all the private
and public interests concerned; and that it be resolved upon, here and
now, that reconstruction be accompanied by universal local option.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>There would be no opposition the Government need count to a proposal
like that.</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United

provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
